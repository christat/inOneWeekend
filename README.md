# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

(Yet another) walkthrough of this fantastic book by Peter Shirley. You can get a hold of it [here](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html) along with other resources.

## Contents

The sources are split into chapter folders, each of them with the incremental code changes specific to that chapter.

## Compile/run

The code can be compiled the following under each chapter's folder:

```
g++ main.cpp -o ch_<N>
```
Then, the executable can be run with:

```
./ch_<N>
```

Where `<N>` denotes the chapter number. 

Note that you need `g++`, or another C++ compiler installed in your machine.
